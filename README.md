##Intro

Counts the number of tags in a page.

With the increasing popularity of Angular directives and Web Components everyone can make their own tags. Are you curious to know what tags build the page? TagCounter does exactly that plus more:

 * Shows the list and total number of tags used to build the page
 * Shows total number of elements used to build the page
 * You can sort the stats by name and number
 * Counts how many of each tag was used
 * It's easy to refresh the stats for dynamically changing pages
 * Identifies standard tag types for HTML 5, HTML 4, SVG, and even W3C drafts
 * Highlights all occurrences of a tag when you hover over it
 * Can filter to show stats about only one type of tag
 * UI looks and feels like the native Chrome developer tools
 * Open source: https://github.com/hanifbbz/TagCounter
 * Made with Angular and LESS

##How does it work?
It injects a tiny script (less than 0.7 KB) into the page. When it is ready it shows a little <n> icon on the address bar. Only when you click that little icon the script counts the tags and shows the statistics table.
